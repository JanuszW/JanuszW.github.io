   <h1>Squiggles</h1>
      <p>Squiggles is a masterpiece made with javascript and completed on repl.it.  This piece of artwork uses numerous things we learned in class throughout the year.  To begin, click the mouse on the canvas; you will witness a line growing across the screen.  Continue making lines by clicking.  Continue clicking until you reach the end.  (Hint - Click more toward the edge of the canvas)</p>
